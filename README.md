# QRanibal the Scanibal

This is a simple Flask web app I wrote to scan QR codes and extract DEV EUIs using the device's camera. It serves a basic HTML page, accesses the camera via `getUserMedia`, and repeatedly sends the captured frames to the Flask `/process_frame` endpoint for server-side decoding.

Please note that this is a very basic proof-of-concept application. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to handle decoding on the client side but I wanted to test out this python library I found that uses an advanced object detection model.

**Therefore, disclaimer:** Use at your own riskâ€”this code is not production-ready.

## Usage

Before all else, let's clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ducktatorrr/qranibal-the-scanible.git

```

#### 2. Run the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 qranibal
```

### From python source

#### 0. Prerequisites:

Besides Python3, you will also need zbar installed on your system.

On **Linux**:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libzbar0
```

On **Mac OS X**:

```bash
brew install zbar
```

**Optional**: Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 1. Install dependencies:
